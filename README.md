# Notation Converter

## The Concept

The idea behind this project is to create a program that quickly and easily converts between mathematical expressions written in infix, postfix, and prefix notation. Making it an excellent learning tool for people interested in learning the concept.

## Theory

We have three general ways of writing a mathematical expression. The one we're most familiar with is called infix notation because the operator is *in*between the operands.
- 2 + 2

Then we have postfix notation where the operator comes *after* ~~post~~ the operands.
- 2 2 +

Finally we have prefix notation where the operator comes *before* ~~pre~~ the operands.
- \+ 2 2
